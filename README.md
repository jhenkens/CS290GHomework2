CS290GHomework2
===============
This is the second homework for Koc's CS290G at UCSB. 
It uses what will eventually be the ECC framework used for my final project for the class.
In order for proper function, make sure that you clone to a directory that does not have spaces in its absolute path.
This is not my bug (as far as I know), but an XCode bug, where the header search path wont work if $(SRC_ROOT) contains spaces.
